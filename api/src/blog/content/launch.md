## Hi, I'm Josh
Welcome to JoshGretz.io, thanks for visitng. The intent that this is going to be my blog / initial hit on the internet. 

This blog is mainly going to be technical - mostly around what I am working on / playing with at the time. My hope is that
someone may find something here some small bit as helpful as I have found so many others writings along my own path.

Here we go ...

### Confession & Resolution
I've had the goal of starting a blog a couple of different times, but for whatever reason - time, topics, discipline - it never stuck. Lately though, I've had the opportunity to do more and more R&D and I've been convicted that I need to start recording what I 
am learning somewhere outside of my mind palace.

TLDR: I've been blessed with a lot of input, now its time to adding to the firehose.

### Inspirations
Here are a couple of my inspirations as I start this journey / journal:

* [Scott Hanselman - You're words are wasted](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourWordsAreWasted.aspx)
* [Corey House - Becoming an Outlier](https://vimeo.com/97415346)

### Tech Stuff
This site currently is a NodeJS backend with React front end. You can find the source on [github](https://github.com/jgretz/joshgretzio).

I find writing in markdown to be clean and easy, and so all of my content is actually written as md files and converted into React by
a nifty little package [react-markdown](https://rexxars.github.io/react-markdown/).
