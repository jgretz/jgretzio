## Hi, I'm Josh
Welcome to JoshGretz.io, thanks for visitng. The intent is that this is going to be my blog / first impression on the internet.

This blog is going to lean in a technical direction - mostly around what I am working on / playing with at the time. My hope is that
someone out there may find some small thing here some fraction as helpful as I have found so many other's writings.

Without further ado ... here we go ...

### Confession & Resolution
TLDR: I've been blessed with a lot of inbound knowledge, now its time to start adding back to the stream of the firehose.

I've had the goal of starting a blog a couple of different times, but for whatever reason - time, topics, discipline - it never stuck. Lately though, I've had the opportunity to do more and more R&D and I've been convicted that I need to start recording what I 
am learning somewhere outside of my mind palace - for my own recall, but also to contribute back to the community.

### Inspirations
Here are a couple of my inspirations as I start this journey / journal:

* [Scott Hanselman - Your words are wasted](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/YourWordsAreWasted.aspx)
* [Corey House - Becoming an Outlier](https://vimeo.com/97415346)

### Tech Stuff
This site is currently a NodeJS backend with React front end. You can find the source on [github](https://github.com/jgretz/joshgretzio).

I find writing in markdown to be clean and easy, and so all of my content is actually written as md files and converted into React by
a nifty little package [react-markdown](https://rexxars.github.io/react-markdown/).
